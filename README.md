The Food Order App I have created is a clear and well-written application that combines many things I have learned on React. The most important topics I have worked on and used include hooks such as useReducer, useRef, useState, useEffect, as well as structures like context, portals, and prop logic. React's component structure has been especially utilized, breaking everything down to the smallest detail to increase code readability, create smaller files, and clearly define their purpose.
